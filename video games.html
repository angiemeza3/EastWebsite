<h2>This is my opinion about Playstation and Xbox.</h2>
<h1>Xbox</h1>
<h2>These are the consoles I play on and have lots of fun playing them.</h2>
<h3>Also, I don't hate Playstation; I like all consoles equal. I am a Xbox person, but there are bad things about it that I'll talk about later.</h3>
<h2>The good things about Xbox is there are a lot of games that you can play, but its mostly first person Shooter games and there are quite a few games that are on sale. You can also play old Xbox games on newer Xboxs.</h2>
<h2>The bad things about Xbox is the unnecessary power brick and you have to pay 15 dollars to play online, but you get over 100 games a month! Or you can just pay 10 dollars to play online!</h2>
<h1>Playstation</h1>
<h2>Now for Playstation, I like Playstation but I am a Xbox person! </h2>
<h2>The good things about Playstation is there are a lot of games that you don't have to be online to play!</h2>
<h3>The bad things about Playstation is there are always people that yell at you or say they will hack you or even boot you offline. This gets old fast.</h3>

    <h3>My favorite game of all time is Black Ops 2, it's the most fun for me.</h3>
    <h3>The story is mostly around Woods telling how Alex Mason died to save David Mason.</h3>
    <h3>These have two different time periods: the past and the future, in the late 1980s and 2025.</h3> 
    <h3>This game story talks about the two Masons the dad and the son.</h3>
